To download updates made available in the fbc Git repository, you can do a pull, either using your preferred graphical Git tool, or in a terminal:<br \>
<br \>
<pre class="fb_pre">git pull</pre><br \>
To take a look at incoming changes <i>before</i> applying them, do this:<br \>
<br \>
<pre class="fb_pre"># Update remote branches
git fetch

# Take a look
gitk --all

# Everything looks ok? Then merge the remote branch into the current branch to apply the update.
git merge origin/master
</pre><br \>
Rebuilding is, most of the time, as easy as as running "make" again. Of course, if you used compilation options (like ENABLE_STANDALONE) for the build, you have to specify them again this time, unless they are (still) set in <tt>config.mk</tt>.<br \>
<br \>
<pre class="fb_pre">make
# or if needed:
make ENABLE_STANDALONE=1</pre><br \>
As a special exception, for the DOS build it is necessary to run <tt>make clean</tt> before <tt>make</tt> to properly rebuild FB after source modules have been renamed or deleted. The reason for this is that under DOS/DJGPP the makefile uses *.o wildcards to link fbc and archive libfb.a etc., instead of passing the explicit .o file names, because it has to obey the command line length limitation. If <tt>make clean</tt> is not run, it may use old left-over object files from a previous build. Luckily, we do not rename or delete source files often.<br \>
