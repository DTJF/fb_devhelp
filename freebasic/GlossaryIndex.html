<b>abstract member function</b><br \>
<div class="fb_indent">A member function without body that must be overridden by a member function of a type more derived than the type it was declared in. See <tt><a href="KeyPgAbstract.html">Abstract (Member)</a></tt>.<br \>
<br \>
</div><b>access rights</b><br \>
<div class="fb_indent">The level of access associated with <tt><a href="KeyPgType.html">Type</a></tt> or <tt><a href="KeyPgClass.html">Class</a></tt> members. Public members are accessible to any code; protected members are accessible to member functions and any derived <tt><a href="KeyPgType.html">Type</a></tt> or <tt><a href="KeyPgClass.html">Class</a></tt> member functions; private members are accessible only to member functions of that <tt><a href="KeyPgType.html">Type</a></tt> or <tt><a href="KeyPgClass.html">Class</a></tt>. By default, <tt><a href="KeyPgType.html">Type</a></tt> members have public access rights, while <tt><a href="KeyPgClass.html">Class</a></tt> members are private.<br \>
<br \>
</div><b>any pointer</b><br \>
<div class="fb_indent">A variable or expression that points to a memory address where it is not known, at least from the compiler's point of view, what type of data is stored at that address.  In C this would be the same as a void pointer or (void *).  See <tt><a href="KeyPgPtr.html">Ptr</a></tt>.<br \>
<br \>
</div><b>archive</b><br \>
<div class="fb_indent">An archive is a group or files or a single file packed into a container format and usually compressed before or afterward. Typical container formats are GNU Tar and Zip. Typical compression formats are Gzip and Zip.<br \>
<br \>
</div><b>argument</b><br \>
<div class="fb_indent">Data that is passed to a procedure. The procedure refers to this data using the parameter(s) in its parameter list.<br \>

<br \>
</div><b>array (container)</b><br \>
<div class="fb_indent">A collection of data whose elements are stored contiguously in memory (one after the other, in increasing order). Because of this, an array offers random-access to its elements (any element can be accessed at any time). Insertion or removal of elements anywhere but at the back of the container requires that those elements that follow be relocated, so a linked-list is typically preferred when insertion or removal needs to be efficient.<br \>
<br \>
</div><b>assembler</b><br \>
<div class="fb_indent">A component in the tool chain for translating source code in to executable programs.  The assembler converts the low level assembly instruction mnemonics emitted by the compiler to object code.<br \>
<br \>
</div><b>assignment</b><br \>
<div class="fb_indent">Assignment is one of the fundamental operations of computing.  All it means is copying a value into the memory location pointed at by a variable.  The value might be a literal, another variable, or the result of some expression. For an instance of a <tt><a href="KeyPgType.html">Type</a></tt> or <tt><a href="KeyPgClass.html">Class</a></tt>, this involves calling one of its assignment operators. Not to be confused with initialization.<br \>
<br \>
</div><b>automatic storage</b><br \>
<div class="fb_indent">Refers to storage on the call stack. Local procedure variables, objects and arrays with automatic storage are allocated when the procedure is called, initialized when defined, destroyed (in the case of objects) when leaving the scope they're declared in and deallocated when returning from the procedure.<br \>
<br \>

</div><b>byval</b><br \>
<div class="fb_indent"><tt><a href="KeyPgByref.html">ByVal</a></tt> specifies passing arguments to procedures by value. Procedures receive a copy of the argument passed. With <tt><a href="KeyPgType.html">Type</a></tt> or <tt><a href="KeyPgClass.html">Class</a></tt> instances, this involves instantiating temporary objects by calling their copy constructor. These temporaries are destroyed upon procedure exit.<br \>
<br \>
</div><b>binaries</b><br \>
<div class="fb_indent">Binaries are the end result of source code. Binaries include executable files (.exe on windows), static library files (.a), dynamic library files (.dll on windows, .so on Linux), and relocatable object files. (.o)<br \>

<br \>
</div><b>buffer</b><br \>
<div class="fb_indent">A region of memory that allows data to be saved or manipulated before being copied somewhere else.  In a communications device this may hold incoming or outgoing data yet to be processed.  In graphics, a buffer may contain an image before being copied to the screen.<br \>

Among the information stored on the call stack are all of the local automatic variables, objects and array data and usually whatever parameters are passed to the procedure. These items are allocated (<i>pushed</i> onto the call stack) when the procedure is called and deallocated (<i>popped</i> from the call stack) when the procedure returns, either by the caller or the callee, depending on the calling convention used. The initial and maximum sizes of this reserved memory vary by platform.<br \>

<div class="fb_indent">A variable, object or array with <b>static storage</b>.<br \>
