	FreeBASIC introduced a -lang command-line option, that is used to change the language compatibility mode. Use the -lang qb option when compiling to select the most QB compatible parser. All differences listed below assume that -lang qb was used.<br \>
<br \>
<b>Architecture/Platform incompatibilities</b><br \>
<ul><li> FreeBASIC is written for 32-bit operating systems and a 32 bit DOS extender, and cannot utilize code which depends on 16-bit DOS, 16 bit assembly or memory model (segment & offset, XMS/EMS, ...). 	<br \>
<li> <tt>DEF SEG</tt> is no longer necessary and will not work - any code which <tt>POKE</tt>s to video memory this way will no longer function, however, for DOS it can be easily rewritten using DPMI features. <br \>
<li> <tt>CALL INTERRUPT</tt> no longer functions, as it relies on 16-bit DOS. DOS interrupts can be called in the DOS32 version by using the DPMI library, but they might work slowly because of the 32bit-16bit-32bit  mode changes the processor will have to perform. <br \>
<br \>
</ul><b>Changed due to ambiguity</b><br \>
<ul><li> A scalar variable and an array with the same name and suffix can no longer share the same name.<br \>
<li> <tt>SHARED</tt> can't be used inside a <tt>SUB</tt> or <tt>FUNCTION</tt> as it resulted in shared variables not defined in the main program. A proper <tt>DIM SHARED</tt> in the main program must be used.<br \>
<li> <tt>COMMON</tt> declarations do not depend on the order they are made, variables are matched by name and for that reason named COMMON is no longer supported. All COMMON arrays are variable-length arrays in FB.<br \>
<li> If a single line <tt><a href="KeyPgIfthen.html">If</a></tt> has an (unnecessary) colon directly after the <tt>THEN</tt>, it has to be terminated by an <tt><a href="KeyPgEndif.html">End If</a></tt> in FB. If that unneeded colon is removed, FB will behave as QB.<br \>
<br \>
</ul><b>Design differences</b><br \>
<ul><li> Graphics support was internally redesigned, see <a href="GfxLib.html">GfxLib overview</a><br \>
<li> <tt>CLEAR</tt> is no longer used to reset all variables and set the stack. Variables must be reset one by one, and stack size can be changed in the compiler command line. The keyword <tt>CLEAR</tt> is used to do memory fills in FB.<br \>
<li> String <tt>DATA</tt> items must be enclosed in quotes in FB, in QB this was optional<br \>
<li> All functions must have been declared, even with a <tt>CALL</tt> in FreeBASIC. With <tt>CALL</tt> it was possible to invoke prototype-less functions in QuickBASIC. (to be supported in future with -lang qb)<br \>
<li> In FreeBASIC all arrays must be explicitly declared. (Interpreted QuickBASIC arrays are automatically created with up to 10 indices.)<br \>
<li> Strings use a null (char <tt>0</tt>) terminator to be compatible with C libraries and the Windows API, fixed-length strings can't contain <tt>chr$(0)</tt> chars for now.<br \>
<li> When <tt>INKEY</tt>[<tt>$</tt>] reads an extended key (Num Pad, Arrows...) it returns a two character string. In FB the first character is <tt>CHR</tt>[<tt>$</tt>]<tt>(255)</tt>, while in QB this first char is <tt>CHR$(0)</tt>. <br \>
<li> With fixed length strings FreeBASIC gives the real length as <tt><a href="KeyPgLen.html">Len</a></tt> plus one (null-char), even on <tt><a href="KeyPgType.html">Type</a></tt> fields.<br \>
<li> In FreeBASIC, unused characters of fixed-length strings are set to <tt>0</tt>, regardless of what "-lang" compiler option is used. In QB, unused characters are set to <tt>32</tt> (space, or " ", in ASCII).<br \>
<li> When a fixed-length string is declared, but still not initialized, all characters are set to 0, both in FreeBASIC and QB.<br \>
<li> The arrays are stored in row-major order in FB, they were stored in column-major order in QB by default. Row major order: data with consecutive last index are contiguous. Column-major order: data with consecutive first index are contiguous.  For example, if you have <tt>DIM A(1 TO 6, 1 TO 8)</tt>, in row-major order the elements are stored such that <tt>A(3,5)</tt> is followed in memory by <tt>A(3,6)</tt>; in column-major order <tt>A(3,5)</tt> is followed in memory by <tt>A(4,5)</tt>.<br \>
<li> Programs don't stop anymore on runtime errors unless <i><a href="CompilerOpte.html">-e</a></i>, <i><a href="CompilerOptex.html">-ex</a></i> or <i><a href="CompilerOptexx.html">-exx</a></i> option is used in the command line. Using these options allow the use of QB style error handling (<tt>ON ERROR</tt>, <tt>RESUME</tt>...).<br \>
<li> Octal numbers are written <tt>&o...</tt>, whereas in QB they could be written as <tt>&o...</tt> or <tt>&...</tt>.<br \>
<li> In FB <tt>FOR</tt> loops in subs/functions do not accept arguments received <tt>byref</tt> as counters. A local variable must be used. <br \>
<li> FB's <tt><a href="KeyPgLocate.html">Locate</a></tt> does not respect the fourth and fifth arguments for cursor shape.<br \>
<li> FB's <tt><a href="KeyPgScreengraphics.html">Screen</a></tt> does not allow switching the visible or the work-page. Use <tt><a href="KeyPgScreenset.html">ScreenSet</a></tt> instead.<br \>
<li> FB's <tt><a href="KeyPgColor.html">Color</a></tt> does not allow a third argument for border color.<br \>
<li> FB's <tt><a href="KeyPgTimer.html">Timer</a></tt> returns the number of seconds since the computer started, while QB's <tt>TIMER</tt> returns the number of seconds since midnight. (Win32 and Linux only: No more wrapping at midnight! :))<br \>
<li> In QB a <tt>chr$(13)</tt> inside a string did a <tt>CR+LF</tt> when <tt>PRINT</tt>ed. In FB the <tt>CHR(13)</tt> prints just at what it is, a <tt>CR</tt>.<br \>
<li> <tt>EOF</tt> can no longer be used to detect an empty comms buffer. Empty buffer should be tested comparing <tt>Loc</tt> with <tt>0</tt> in FB. Also, for files opened in <tt>RANDOM</tt> or <tt>BINARY</tt> mode, <tt>EOF</tt> returns non-zero already after reading exactly the file size, see <tt><a href="KeyPgEof.html">EOF</a></tt>.<br \>
<li> Integer variables do not signal overflow errors in FB, even with the <i><a href="CompilerOptex.html">-ex</a></i> or <i><a href="CompilerOptexx.html">-exx</a></i> option on. Any QB code relying in catching integer overflow errors will not work in FB. <br \>
<br \>
</ul><b>Archaic commands</b><br \>
<ul><li> <tt>BSAVE</tt> and <tt>BLOAD</tt> can be used in FB only to save and retrieve screens or graphic buffers. They will work only if gfxlib is linked, this is,  if a graphics screen mode is requested somewhere in the program. The console can't be saved with <tt>BSAVE</tt> or retrieved with <tt>BLOAD</tt>. The other use of <tt>BSAVE</tt>-<tt>BLOAD</tt>, saving and loading full arrays, can be achieved easily with <tt>GET</tt> and <tt>PUT</tt>.<br \>
<li> <tt>FIELD</tt> statement (for record definition at runtime) has been left aside. The keyword <tt>FIELD</tt> is used in FB to specify field alignment in <tt><a href="KeyPgType.html">Type</a></tt> variables.<br \>
<li> PC Speaker commands no longer function: Any references to <tt>SOUND</tt> or <tt>PLAY</tt> statements will result in an error message. There is a third party library available to emulate this functionality, but it's not included with FreeBASIC.<br \>
<li> Fake event-driven programming (<tt>ON KEY</tt>, <tt>ON PEN</tt>, <tt>ON STRIG</tt>, <tt>ON TIMER</tt>) no longer works. They could be emulated by a separate library.<br \>
<li> <tt>MKSMBF$</tt> and all the <tt>MKxMBF$</tt> commands supporting the pre-QB4.0 Microsoft proprietary floating point format (MBF) are not implemented.<br \>
<li> The use of parenthesis in the arguments passed to a function to emulate by-value passing is not permitted. The <tt>CALL</tt> quirk resulting in all arguments being passed by value, no longer works. The proper <tt><a href="KeyPgByval.html">ByVal</a></tt> and <tt><a href="KeyPgByref.html">ByRef</a></tt> keywords must be used.<br \>
<li> <tt>FILES</tt> is not implemented. Instead, PDS 7.1-compatible <tt><a href="KeyPgDir.html">Dir</a></tt>[<tt>$</tt>] can be used.<br \>
<li> <tt>IOCTL</tt>, <tt>ERRDEV</tt> and <tt>ERRDEV$</tt>, low level functions to access hardware are not implemented as they were OS-dependent. <br \>
<li> <tt>CALL ABSOLUTE</tt> to run inline machine code is no longer supported. Instead you can use <tt><a href="KeyPgAsm.html">Asm</a>...END ASM</tt> blocks to insert inline assembler commands. Or use the <tt>ASM ...</tt> one line command.<br \>
